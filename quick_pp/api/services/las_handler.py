        Processes uploaded LAS files by saving them and converting to Parquet format.

        Input:
        - files: List of LAS files uploaded as multipart/form-data. Each file must have a .las or .LAS extension.

        Request:
        - Content-Type: multipart/form-data
        - Field: files (required) â€” one or more LAS files to be processed.

        Example (using curl):
        curl -X POST "<host>/las_handler" -F "files=@/path/to/file1.las" -F "files=@/path/to/file2.las"

        Workflow:
        - For each file:
            1. Validate file extension (.las or .LAS).
            2. Generate a unique file name using a hash of the file content and the original filename.
            3. Save the raw LAS file to 'uploads/las/'.
            4. Convert the LAS file to Parquet and save to 'uploads/parquet/'.
            5. Raise HTTP 500 error if something goes wrong.
            6. Ensure the uploaded file is closed after processing.

        Returns:
        - message: Success message listing the original filenames processed.
        - file_paths: List of output Parquet file paths (relative to the server).

        Raises:
        - HTTPException 400: If file extension is invalid.
        - HTTPException 500: On any processing error.
