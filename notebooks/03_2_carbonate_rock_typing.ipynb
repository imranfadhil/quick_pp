    "The process of rock typing is a multidisciplinary effort that involves close collaboration between geologists, petrophysicists, and reservoir engineers. Each discipline plays a specific role, and the rock typing workflow involves a seamless transition of data, models, and insights across these domains to build a robust understanding of the reservoir. Below is the high-level workflow detailing the steps, key tasks, and handoffs between these professionals\n",

    "Petrophysicists take geological inputs and combine them with well log data and core analysis to define rock types based on petrophysical properties such as porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, and pore geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "- Core Data Integration:\n",
    "    - Perform routine and special core analyses (RCAL, SCAL) to measure porosity, permeability, capillary pressure, and wettability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log Interpretation:\n",
    "    - Interpret wireline logs (e.g., density, neutron, resistivity, NMR) to generate continuous petrophysical properties along the wellbore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rock Typing Methods:\n",
    "    - Use statistical tools like Flow Zone Indicator (FZI), Pickett plots, and cluster analysis to group rocks with similar flow behavior into petrophysical rock types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Electrofacies Analysis:\n",
    "    - Identify electrofacies by clustering log responses, especially where core data is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rock typing workflow is a collaborative process where geologists, petrophysicists, and reservoir engineers work together to ensure the reservoir is accurately characterized and modeled. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that both geological and petrophysical complexities are accounted for, resulting in more efficient production strategies and better field development plans"

    "1. Flow Zone Index (FZI) Method\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Ward’s Method\n",
    "    - Ward’s method is a hierarchical clustering technique that minimizes the total within-cluster variance. It starts with each observation in its own cluster and merges clusters iteratively to minimize the increase in total within-cluster variance1. This method is particularly useful for quantitative variables and can be visualized using a dendrogram, which helps in identifying the optimal number of clusters (rock types).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lorenz Method\n",
    "    - The Lorenz method, often used in petrophysical analysis, involves plotting cumulative storage capacity against cumulative flow capacity. This method helps in identifying distinct rock types based on their flow properties. By analyzing the Lorenz plot, you can determine the number of rock types and their respective contributions to storage and flow capacities2."
